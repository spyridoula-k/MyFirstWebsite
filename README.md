# Wellness Retreats - Website Project

The Wellness Retreats Website is a platform designed to promote and facilitate the organization of multi-day wellness events. Created for a team specializing in 3-day and 4-day retreats, the website serves as a digital hub where users can explore, register, and engage with upcoming wellness experiences. The retreats focus on holistic well-being, offering activities such as Pilates, Yoga, Tai Chi, Meditation, and Hiking in serene, nature-immersed locations. This project aims to provide detailed event descriptions, including schedules, instructors' bios, pricing and FAQs. The responsive design makes it easy for users to engage with the site whether they’re on desktop, tablet or mobile.

This project is ideal for:

✔️ Wellness event organizers seeking an efficient online presence.

✔️ Individuals looking for structured retreats to enhance their mental and physical well-being.

✔️ Yoga, Pilates, and mindfulness practitioners interested in expanding their wellness journey.
